# Assignment 1: Apply Time Series Techniques to New Datasets

## Objective

Practice the time series analysis techniques you've learned in previous chapters by applying them to new datasets.

## Instructions

1. **Copy notebooks from prior chapters** into this assignment folder
2. **Choose a dataset** from the available options (see below)
3. **Replicate the analysis steps** from the course notebooks using your chosen dataset
4. **Experiment and explore** - try different approaches and visualizations

## Available Datasets

### EIA Energy Data
- **Location**: `../../data/EIA/`
- **Download Instructions**: See `../../data/EIA/scripts/download.ipynb`
- **What it contains**: Hourly electricity generation data by fuel type (coal, natural gas, wind, hydro, etc.)
- **Use cases**: Energy demand forecasting, renewable energy analysis, seasonal patterns

### FRED Economic Data
- **Location**: `../../data/FRED/`
- **Download Instructions**: See `../../data/FRED/download.ipynb`
- **What it contains**: Economic indicators (unemployment rate, inflation, S&P 500, etc.)
- **Use cases**: Economic forecasting, correlation analysis, trend detection

## Additional Resources

For more examples and detailed analysis walkthroughs, check out the **article resources** in the LinkedIn Learning course chapter.

## Getting Started

1. Download your chosen dataset using the instructions in the data folders
2. Copy relevant notebooks from CH01 or CH02 to this folder
3. Modify the notebooks to load and analyze your new dataset
4. Apply the same techniques (visualization, decomposition, stationarity testing, etc.)

Good luck with your analysis!
